Have you ever wondered whether something was recyclable or compostable? gigo is here to help! gigo uses a CNN-transfer learning architecture trained on thousands of images to categorize items into various categories of waste, and recommends the most ideal, sustainable way to dispose of the item. Our ultimate goal is to connect gigo's classification API to IoT-enabled recycling bins to provide real-time disposal recommendations.
